# Kamiroth-GUI-Edition
![Background](https://github.com/kenny2892/Kamiroth-GUI-Edition/blob/master/My%20Game%20-%20GUI%20Edition/src/resources/images/MainBG.png)

This was my first attempt at making a GUI program. It is a gui version of my Pokemon style battle game. [The original](https://github.com/kenny2892/Kamiroth-Console-Edition/blob/master/README.md) was created for command line and had much more content.The game's name was created by a random name generator.

I put this project on hiatus because of school and because I wanted to learn more about Gui development and programming in general. I figured that I would be able to come back to this and find many things wrong with it, and I most certainly can.

Because I stopped working on it midway, there are a few things wrong or uncomplete:
  - I never implemented the story mode.
  - The character select screen doesn't save the correct photo.
  - The fighting ui is clunky and can be buggy.
  - The ui as a whole has no theme because I was constantly changing things up.
  - And many more I can't remember.
  
I do not own many of the assets in this (especially the background and any of the character portraits) and if one of them is yours, then I'd be happy to remove it.
